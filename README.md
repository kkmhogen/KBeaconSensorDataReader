# KBeacon Sensor data reader Demo
The java project was compiled on JDK1.7.
This demo can be used to connect to the KKM gateway, read KBeacon temperature and humidity records through the KKM gateway, and save the temperature and humidity records to a CSV file. If you have KKM's Beacon and gateway, you can use this demo to verify the reading of sensor data records.
